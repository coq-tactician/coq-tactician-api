This dataset contains data extracted from formal knowledge encoded in the Coq
Proof Assistant. Data is present in both a graph-format and a text-format.

TODO: Link to relevant literature.

                             Accessing the data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data is encoded using the Cap'n Proto serialization protocol, allowing for
fast random access to the graph from many programming languages. The schema and
documentation for the data can be found in 'meta/graph_api.capnp'. For further
information about Cap'n Proto, we refer to https://capnproto.org/

For Python, a library called PyTactician (TODO: Link to Pypi and documentation)
is provided that allows for easy and efficient access to the data. It includes
software to visualize the dataset, a sanity checker for the dataset, an example
prediction server that interfaces with Coq, an Oracle prediction server and
a client for the reinforcement learning component.

The data in this archive is represented as a SquashFS image 'dataset.squ'.
If you are using the PyTactician library, you can load the dataset by pointing
directly to this image. This will automatically mount the image in directory
'dataset/'. For example:

pytact-check dataset.squ
pytact-visualize dataset.squ

In order to make this work, 'squashfuse' needs to be installed through your
favorite package manager. If you prefer to mount manually, or if you are not
using the PyTactician library, you can mount the image using

squashfuse dataset.squ dataset/
pytact-check dataset/
pytact-visualize dataset/

If you have root access, you can mount the image more efficiently through

mount dataset.squ dataset/

Finally, you can also unpack the image without mounting it. However, on systems
with limited memory or slow hard-disks this will lead to performance
degradations while accessing the dataset. Experiments show that, due to the
high decompression speed of the image's LZ4 compression algorithm, mounting is
almost always preferrable to unpacking. Nevertheless, if you wich to unpack, you
can run:

unsquashfs -dest dataset/ dataset.squ

If you wish to inspect the raw data in the dataset manually, you can convert
an individual file in the dataset to JSON as follows:

dataset/coq-tactician-stdlib.8.11.dev/theories/Init/Logic.bin | \
    capnp convert binary:json meta/graph_api.capnp Dataset

You can process the resulting JSON further using, for example, the 'jq' command.
