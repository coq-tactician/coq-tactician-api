# Reinforcement learning for Tactician

## Assumptions

The recommended `opam` version is `>= 2.1.0`. Other versions might work as well, but you may have to install some dependencies manually.

Notice: the installation depends on ocaml version 4.11.2 that is in conflict with glibc version >= 2.34
and therefore fails on Ubuntu 21.10. 

On Ubuntu 20.04 the packages installed by the following are required:

```
sudo apt-get --yes install graphviz capnproto libcapnp-dev pkg-config libev-dev
```

## Installation

Notice: with current limitation of pin-depends and pinned relative path it is strictly necessary to execute
`opam install ./coq-tactician-reinforce.opam --yes` in the below script from the directory of the opam file.

```
opam switch create tact --empty &&  eval $(opam env --switch=tact)
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released     # packages for officially released versions of Coq library
opam repo add coq-core-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/core-dev     # packages for development versions of Coq
opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev   # packages for development versions of Coq libraries and Coq extensions
opam repo add custom-archive https://github.com/LasseBlaauwbroek/custom-archive.git # for Lasse's bugfixes of Coq 
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:coq-tactician/coq-tactician-reinforce.git
cd coq-tactician-reinforce
opam install ./coq-tactician-reinforce.opam --yes
```

## Available Commands

These commands will create a graph of some object, and write it to `graph.pdf` (if `graphviz` is available).

The following commands are always available:
```
[Full] [LGraph | Graph | DAG] Ident identifier.
[Full] [LGraph | Graph | DAG] Term term.
```
Normally, the commands print a non-transitive graph. The `[Full]` modifier changes this so that the full transitive graph of definitions is added.

Additionally, in proof mode, these commands are available:
```
[Full] [LGraph | Graph | DAG] Proof.
```

Options that modify the graphs generated by the commands above are
```
[Set | Unset] Tactician Reinforce Visualize Ordered.
[Set | Unset] Tactician Reinforce Visualize Labels.
```

## Reinforcement 

Finally, the command `Reinforce.` will initiate a reinforcement session. An example of this is available in
[tests/ReinforceTest.v](theories/ReinforceTest.v).
To do this, you need to have a python client running. An example is available in pip package `pytact` that you can install 
with 
```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/coq-tactician/coq-tactician-reinforce.git
```

To see how it works, run 
```
pytact-test
```
optionally `--file` option to point to a source Coq `.v` file. 
Also with `--interactive` option the innteractive shell appears where you can
manually interact with the environment. Whenever a tactic is executed,
the resulting proof state if visualized in the file
`python_graph.pdf`.

## Python package 
We package the python package `pytact` in `setup.py` with python source code in `pytact`. To conveniently work on python code from the directory of `setup.py` run
```
pip install -e .
```
This installs python package in developer mode, so that python code updates propagate immediately
to the installed package.
